# RV32I_VHDL_datapath
This is a VHDL implementation of a RISC V 32I processor datapath. 
Current iteration is a 5 stage pipeline, with register forwarding and branch prediction (assume not taken).


This project is currently a WIP.

TODO:
1. Pull all fles from VHDL dump repository
2. Port map all individual files together

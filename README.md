# RV32I_VHDL_datapath
This is a VHDL implementation of a RISC V 32I processor datapath. 
Current iteration is a 5 stage pipeline with register forwarding and branch prediction (assume not taken).


This project is currently a WIP.

TODO:
1. Port map all individual files together
2. Implement intruction and data caches
3. Implement cache arbiter
